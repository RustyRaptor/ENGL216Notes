## Comparing cloud hosting services for machine learning and deep learning applications. 

### Amazon AWS

### Microsoft Azure

### Google Cloud Console

### OpenStack


I will be comparing cloud hosting services and solutions based on how useful they are for machine learning/deep learning development. 

- Amazon AWS
Amazon's cloud hosting services
- Microsoft Azure
Microsofts suite of cloud services
- Google Cloud Console
Google's cloud computation services
- Openstack
An open source, locally hosted solution for cloud computing. 
 

Criterion:

- Number and variety of services provided. 

- Availability of machine learning and deep learning tools

- typical costs of storage space (rated relative to each other) 

- typical costs of computational tasks (rated relative to each other)

- Cost and feasibility of migration or integration with other services (rated relative to each other)

At my job we are using Amazon AWS and sagemaker to develop machine learning algorithms that detect damage in images of crops. Thousands of companies around the world are using similar services to develop with machine learning and would be interested in what each of these services/solutions offer.
