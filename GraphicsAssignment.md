## Comparing cloud hosting services for machine learning and deep learning applications. 

### Amazon AWS
#### Amazon's cloud hosting services
- Number of machine learning services it provides.

- typical costs of storage space (rated relative to each other) 

- typical costs of computational tasks (rated relative to each other)

- Documentation Readability and usability. 

### Microsoft Azure
#### Microsoft's suite of cloud services
- Number of machine learning services it provides.

- typical costs of storage space (rated relative to each other) 

- typical costs of computational tasks (rated relative to each other)

- Documentation Readability and usability. 
### Google Cloud Console
#### Google's cloud computation services
- Number of machine learning services it provides.

- typical costs of storage space (rated relative to each other) 

- typical costs of computational tasks (rated relative to each other)

- Documentation Readability and usability. 
### IBM Cloud
#### IBM's cloud hosting solution which hosts IBM watson AI services as well. 
- Number of machine learning services it provides.

- typical costs of storage space (rated relative to each other)

    - A bit biased towards microsoft given they have microsoft's branding in many places on their company page.
    - They are clearly an expert source. The focus of their company is clearly IT research and development engineering

    - may be biased towards AWS because they are a company that provides enterprise services for data protection on AWS

###### I will be comparing cloud hosting services and solutions based on how useful they are for machine learning/deep learning development.

###### At my job we are using Amazon AWS and sagemaker to develop machine learning algorithms that detect damage in images of crops. Thousands of companies around the world are using similar services to develop with machine learning and would be interested in what each of these services/solutions offer.
