## Benchmarks
- Static benchmarks are useful for optimizing specific aspects of a browser's performance but are only useful to a certain extent. Once that aspect is optimized past a certain point it becomes redundant and does not make a difference in real-world performance.
- It has been shown that static benchmarks when used too much can eventually harm a browser's performance in real-worls web applications.

## Introduction

### What do web browsers do today?
- Not a lot of people realize the true extent to which browsers are now used in everyday computing.
- It used to be that browsers were simply tools to view static documents on the web and perform very trivial tasks.
- Today web applications do about as much as normal native applications the exceptions being things that are resource heavy such as advanced graphics and video editing but even that line is beginning to blur with a new technology called web assembly which can compile native code to develop high performance web applications.
- This experiment will be evaluating the real-world performance of the two major web browsers of today, Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.
